## Motivation

You have been using python for analyzing your data but considering the growth in volume and complexity 
you are now willing to make a further step.  This lesson will teach you how to start using PySpark and 
introduce you to the map-reduce programming model.

## Before starting the workshop

To ease our work and avoid installing Spark on your laptop, we will be using the [UIO Galaxy eduPortal](https://geoportal-jupyter01.hpc.uio.no/).
If you haven't received a login and password yet, don't panic. This can be handled in few minutes during the workshop.

&nbsp;

**Remark**: without changing your pySpark code, you can scale up to hundred processors on UIO HPC abel... For more information

## Introduction to UIO Galaxy eduPortal

We'll be using [UIO Galaxy eduPortal](https://geoportal-jupyter01.hpc.uio.no/): [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) is an open source,
web-based platform for data intensive that has been initially developed for biomedical research. 

Galaxy is a scientific workflow, data integration, and data and analysis persistence and publishing platform that aims to 
make data intensive accessible to research scientists that do not have extensive computer programming experience.
To learn more, take one of our [Galaxy tours](https://usegalaxy.org/tours).
