Everyone heard about Big data but what is it really?
And what can we do with it? How can we handle several terabytes datasets?

In this lesson, we introduce Big data analysis using PySpark.


The Spark Python API (PySpark) exposes the Spark programming 
model to Python. [Apache® Spark™](http://spark.apache.org/) is an open source and is one of the most popular Big Data frameworks for scaling up your tasks in a cluster. It was developed to utilize distributed, in-memory data structures to improve data processing speeds. 

> ## Prerequisites
>
> A basic knowledge of python is recommended 
> but you don't need to have any previous knowledge 
> of big data analysis or [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/).
